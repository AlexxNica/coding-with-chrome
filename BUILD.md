`genfiles/chrome_app` folder in other platforms like Mac OS X as well.

## How to build your own Coding with Chrome App

### Get the sources
Download the source files manual from GitHub or with git by running:
```bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/google/coding-with-chrome.git
```

### Init / update submodules
In some cases you need to init and update the submodules manually by:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Get required packages
Enter the "coding-with-chrome" directory and get the required packages by:
```bash
npm install
```

### Sync the project folder
In order to update all dependencies automatically, just run the following command:
```bash
npm run sync
```

### Build and run the actual app
To compile and run the Chrome app use the following command:
```bash
npm run chrome-app
```
This will automatically build and start the application on Mac OS, Linux or
Windows.

### Build the actual app
To only compile the Chrome app run the build script with the following command:
```bash
npm run build-core
npm run build-chrome_app
```
The build version will be compiled in the `genfiles/chrome_app` directory, together with all required packages and files.
