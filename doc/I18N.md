Coding with Chrome - i18n translation
======================================

### Translation
If you want to help with the translation perform the following steps:
* Navigate around in the UI part you want to translate
* Open the Chrome Developer Tools inside the Coding with Chrome App
* Type the following command into the console:
```javascript
i18n.getToDo()
```
This will return a list of all untranslated text for your language.

Add your translations to the output and place them into the file
 `app/_locales/[language]/message.json`.
