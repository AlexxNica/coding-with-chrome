Coding with Chrome - i18n translation
======================================

Status: WIP

### Translation of untranslated text
Perform the following steps:
* Enable the Debug Mode under Settings -> Misc - Debug Mode
* Restart the app
* Navigate around in the UI part you want to translate
* Open the Chrome Developer Tools inside the Coding with Chrome App
* Go to the "hamburger" menu and click on the "Debug" icon
* In the new window click on i18n Untranslated

This will return a list of all untranslated text for your language in the
Chrome Console.

Add your translations to the output and place them into the file
`src/locales/[language]/translation.json`.
 

### Additional language support
If your language is currently not support, create a copy of the
"src/locales/en" folder and rename the folder to your language.

Translate the existing text to your language and create a pull request for
this file.


### Missing translations
If you miss the translation for certain UI parts, please submit pull request to 
add them.

#### In JavaScript files
Use the global "i18t" function to add the translation to any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is translated by 
general functions instead directly.
```js
  i18t('Some untranslated text')
```

#### In soy files
For soy files, use the {msg desc=""} {/msg} tags to mark any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is translated by 
general functions instead directly.
```js
  {msg desc=""}
    Welcome to Coding with Chrome!
  {/msg}
```
